## ‚ö° Quick Setup

You should already have a `l10n.yaml` file in your project. If not, create one.  
This extension uses Flutter's official options for internationalization. See [Flutter's i18n docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization#configuring-the-l10n-yaml-file)

The extension also supports additional options:

### Extension-specific `l10n.yaml` options (with defaults)
```yaml
# Enable translation (via DeepL)
translate: true              

# Auto-run flutter gen-l10n after extraction              
generate: true       

# Key prefix for translations             
key-prefix: AppLocalizations.of(context)!.  

# Generate key name
# "ask" = prompt with pre-filled text, true = infer from text, false = prompt manually  
auto-name-key: true       

# Language to use for key name generation                 
key-name-language: en       

# Import line to insert if needed                
import-line: ""                             
```

For the translation feature to work, you need to add your Deepl API key in vscode settings.json file:

`"flutter.deeplApiKey": "your-key",`   

You can get a generous free API key [here](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro#developer)

And that's it! You're ready to go üöÄ


## üòé Pro tips
You can define an extension getter to access your translations more concisely:
```dart
extension ContextExt on BuildContext {
  AppLocalizations get t => AppLocalizations.of(this);
}

// then instead of this
Text(AppLocalizations.of(context).yourKey)

// use it like this:
Text(context.t.yourKey)
```
Don't forget to update the `key-prefix` & `import-line` options in l10n.yaml ;)
